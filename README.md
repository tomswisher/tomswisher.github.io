## Background
I'm a huge fan of [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), the data visualization JavaScript library created by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/), [Jeffrey Heer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/), and a [community](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/graphs/contributors) of open source contributors.

Bostock maintains [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) which serves as a defacto repository for the Datavis community's examples and sketches. Using his Node.js program [gistup](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/) or [browser extenstion](https://github.com/mbostock/bl.ocks.org/blob/master/README.md) you can upload a git project and host all the files you need for a modestly sized [static](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15719098) webapp. [Ian Johnson](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1058500513) is working on a [project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1058500513/building-blocks-0) to remove the command-line aspect and bring bl.ock-making to more users.

## Helpful Resources
[bl.ocksplorer.org](http://bl.ocksplorer.org/)
* A customized search engine for bl.ocks.org. Give it a D3 function and you will see a list of relevant projects. Created by [Irene Ros](http://ireneros.com/) and [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/).

[Data Visualization & D3.js Weekly Newsletter](https://www.dashingd3js.com/data-visualization-and-d3-newsletter)
* A short curated weekly list of articles, reading, and videos on D3 and Datavis. Collected by [Sebastian Gutierrez](https://www.dashingd3js.com/about) of [Dashing D3js](https://www.dashingd3js.com).

[NYC D3.js group through Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-D3-JS/)
* A monthly event focused on D3 and Datavis with speakers, socializing, and refreshments. Formerly organized by Sebastian Gutierrez, now run by [Amit Schechter and Natalie Wesson](http://two-n.com/team/) of [TWO-N](http://www.two-n.com/).

[Data Stories podcast](http://datastori.es/)
* Possibly the best Datavis podcast, covering a wide breadth of guests and topics. Many episodes are interviews, some explore a specific topic, and increasingly more are breakdowns of a project alongside its authors. Hosted by [Enrico Bertini](http://enrico.bertini.io/) and [Moritz Stefaner](http://moritz.stefaner.eu/).

[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345)
* The definitive textbook for starting out in D3 (and JavaScript+HTML+CSS). Written by [Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/) and sold through O'Reilly. Scott was cool enough to write a free interactive webapp version with live code! This is the book I used to get started. I knew basically no JavaScript before reading it, and he cut through the fog better than all the other textbooks I tried.
