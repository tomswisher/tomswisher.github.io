## Background
I'm a huge fan of [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), the data visualization JavaScript library created by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/), [Jeffrey Heer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/), and a [community](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/graphs/contributors) of open source contributors.

Bostock maintains [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) which serves as a defacto repository for the Datavis community's examples and sketches. Using his Node.js program [gistup](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/) or [browser extenstion](https://github.com/mbostock/bl.ocks.org/blob/master/README.md) you can upload a git project and host all the files you need for a modestly sized [static](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15719098) webapp. [Ian Johnson](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1058500513/building-blocks-0) is working on a [project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1058500513/building-blocks-0) to remove the command-line aspect and bring bl.ock-making to more users.

## Helpful Resources

[Data Stories podcast](http://datastori.es/)
* One of the best Datavis podcasts, covering a wide breadth of guests and topics. Many episodes are interviews, some explore ideas, and increasingly more are specific break-downs of projects alongside their authors. Hosted by [Enrico Bertini](http://enrico.bertini.me/) and [Moritz Stefaner](http://moritz.stefaner.eu/).

[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)
* The definitive textbook for starting out in D3 (and JavaScript+HTML+CSS). Written by [Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/) and sold through O'Reilly. Scott was cool enough to write a free interactive webapp version with live code! This is the book I used to get started. I knew basically no JavaScript before reading it, and he cut through the fog better than all the other textbooks I tried.
