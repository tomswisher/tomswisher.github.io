## Background
I'm a huge fan of [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), the Data Visualization JavaScript library created by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/), [Jeff Heer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/), and a [community](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/graphs/contributors) of open source contributors. Bostock maintains [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) which serves as a defacto repository for the Dataviz community's examples and sketches. Using his Node.js program [gistup](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/) or [Block Builder]() by [Ian Johnson]() you can upload a git project and host all the files you need for a modestly sized [static](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15719098) webapp.

## Selected Projects
* [Constellation](http://bl.ocks.org/tomswisher/raw/58e0ac7cd6da86e391a1/) (single-axis version)
* [Piarkanoid](http://bl.ocks.org/tomswisher/raw/09898dca3a6ca4ebfa33) (needs scoring and hit detection for rotated keys)

## Helpful Resources

[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345)

One of the best and most complete books for practicing Dataviz people. Nothing beats it as a followup to Scott's book.

[Crossfilter](http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/)
* An optimized JS library for exploring and filtering large multivariate datasets in the browser. Very useful when making high-dimension visualizations.

[Data Visualization & D3.js Weekly Newsletter](https://www.dashingd3js.com/data-visualization-and-d3-newsletter)
* A short curated weekly list of articles, reading, and videos on D3 and Dataviz. Collected by [Sebastian Gutierrez](https://www.dashingd3js.com/about) of [Dashing D3js](https://www.dashingd3js.com).

[Data Stories podcast](http://datastori.es/)
* One of the best Dataviz podcasts, covering a wide breadth of guests and topics. Many episodes are interviews, some explore a specific topic, and increasingly more are breakdowns of a project alongside its authors. Hosted by [Enrico Bertini](http://enrico.bertini.io/) and [Moritz Stefaner](http://moritz.stefaner.eu/).
